If I don't have you with me, I'm alone
You know I never know which way to go
I think I need you with me for all-time
When I need new direction for my mind

You'll listen to my lectures on the phone
You'll help me find the treasure in the hole
You'll tell me if I'm acting like a fool
I know that you're not something to lose, now
